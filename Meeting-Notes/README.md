## 👋 Introduction
Come on in! This is the place where the magic happens – where we share thoughts, ideas, and laughter. Our meeting notes are your backstage pass to the awesome things we're up to.

## 📁 Folder Structure
We like to keep things neat and tidy. Each meeting gets its own folder organized by date, with notes and any cool attachments tucked away safely in the "attachments" folder.
